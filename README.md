PerFit is a simple 3D game. There are squares and a panel, for the *Perfect Fit* you should rotate panel, so square can fit to the panel. There are two scores -above one is height of the panel, below one is real score- after every perfect fit these scores inreases. Also there are special squares and every special square has different effect for a while.

- slow square: reduce the game speed

- square rain: more squares spawn than usual.

- reverse square: left is right, right is left.

- expand sqaure: panel is wider than usual.
